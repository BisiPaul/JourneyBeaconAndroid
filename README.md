# JourneyBeaconAndroid

An Android applciation I developed during the Hack TM 2023 hackathon.

The idea of the project was a BLE beacon-based mean of specific ride detection and payment for public transport.

It contains:
- Google Sign-In/Sign-out
- a Bluetooth beacon detection system implemented using AltBeacon
- integration with an Azure backend for storing and fetching the user's previous payments
